Why I write short blog posts:

1. For documentation, especially for programming-related ideas.
2. To encourage reflection; to avoid passive consumption of entertainment.
3. To work on my writing, a skill I've neglected in recent years.

It's an active experiment, and judging by my past projects have gone, it won't last for too long. Nonetheless, I hope I learn something by doing it, instead of just talking about it.
