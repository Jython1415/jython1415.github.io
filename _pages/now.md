I wrote part of this update during a quiet moment at my tutoring job.

## Priorities

1. Landing a job
1. Graduate!
1. Figuring out the move to Boston

## Projects

### Learning about MCP and other scaffolding around LLMs

I've started taking my usage of Claude more seriously to try to get as much value as I can out of it. The macOS application for Claude allows you to give Claude access to MCP servers running on your own machine, so I'm learning how to set up and program simple MCP servers on my own. I tried setting up my own MCP server for Bluesky access, but someone had a great one alreaady, so we chatted and the developer ended up implementing the features I was looking for. I'll have to find another MCP project to set up myself.

Maybe I'll end up setting up the Bluesky MCP server anyway so that I can limit the feature-set to what I actually use.

### Knowledge Management System

I enjoy writing down my thoughts, but I've become more frustrated at how distributed my system is.

- Bluesky for small thoughts I can post publicly
- Apple Notes for small thoughts I can't post publicly
- Obsidian for longer thoughts, notes, explanations, etc.
- macOS file system for reference material: PDFs, images, etc.
- Personal blog (hosted by GitHub) for longer material that I can publish

It would be great if all my notes and thoughts could be stored and searched in a single location. None of the existing technologies work for me, and I'm more than happy to try to create my own, so I may make it a project to try to set up a PKMS that meets my needs. I will probably end up posting updates on Bluesky and this website as I made progress on that.

## Media

### Bluesky

For better or for worse, most of my input (news, tech stuff, etc.) is coming from Bluesky. I follow a bunch of tech people that I find interesting, and I also keep up with some of the reputable news-related feeds. I'm interested in setting up an RSS reader at some point because there are a number of blogs I'd like to follow, but I don't have a good mechanism for doing that.

## Recent Highlights

### Injured Heel

Not a highlight, but my heel has been bothering me since the racquetball tournament back in March. I've tried to avoid running and other activities, but it's hard to keep it up forever. I played a bit of badminton on it last weekend to test it out, and... still injured. I guess I'm going to have to keep resting it for now.

### Apartment

My partner and I figured out where we're going to be living after graduation, which is good to have sorted out. Now I just need to figure out how I'm going to be making money after the move.
